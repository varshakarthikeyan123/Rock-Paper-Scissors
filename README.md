## How It Works ⚙️
1. The program asks the player to choose **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The program compares both choices:
   - Rock beats Scissors  
   - Scissors beats Paper  
   - Paper beats Rock
4. The result is displayed (Win, Lose, or Draw).
5. The game continues until the player decides to quit.
